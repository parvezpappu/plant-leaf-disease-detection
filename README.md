# 🌿 Plant Leaf Disease Detection

A deep learning web app built with **Streamlit** that identifies plant leaf conditions as **Healthy** And **Multiple Diseases** from uploaded images.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Upload plant leaf images (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`)
- Predicts the condition of the leaf
- Displays prediction confidence
- Interactive and lightweight Streamlit UI

---

## 🧠 Model Information
The classification model (`model.h5`) is trained using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** on a curated dataset of plant leaf images.

### **Classes**
| Class Name | Description |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Healthy** | The leaf shows no visible signs of disease |
| **Diseases** | The leaf is affected by a disease|
